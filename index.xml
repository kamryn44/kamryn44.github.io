      <description>Introduction
This dataset (from the 1986 Medicaid Consumer Survey) is comprised of 996 people (observations) in California who were eligible to claim Medicaid benefits at the time. The study participants have been split into two groups: one group contains people who are enrolled in a managed care demonstration program and the other group is a fee-for-service comparison group of non-enrollees. There are a total of 14 variables for each observed participant, some of which include: “visits” for the number of visits to the doctor they made in 1986; “age” for the age of the respondent; “income” indicating the annual household income (an averaged range); “health1”, which represents the first principal component (divided by 1000)of three health-status variables: functional limitations, acute conditions, and chronic condition; “access”, indicative of the availability of services for the respondent (0 = low access, 1 = high access); “gender”, with options of female or male; and “enroll”, which is a factor stating whether the individual is or is not enrolled in a demonstration program.</description>

      <description>Introduction
One of the two datasets is called Political (renamed to college_voters) and describes a dataset of the “Polical Behvaior of College Students”. After taking a simple random sample of 60 students at Grinnel College (United States) in 1992, two fellow college students were able to obtain 59 responses on nine variables through phone interviews. Of the nine variables, those that were used in this analysis included:“Year”- the class year of school the respondent was in; “Sex” - noted as a numeric observation, valuing male = 0 or female = 1; “Vote” - referencing the voting status of the respondent as they apply to the four options of 0 (not eligible to vote), 1 (elegible but not registered to vote), 2 (registered but did not vote), and 3 (voted); “Ethics” - a scale (1-5) of how the respondent believed politics should be ruled by (1 being on the side of ethical considerations and 5 on the side of practical power); and, lastly, “Inform” - another scale, this one representing how informed the respondent felt about politics (from 1, meaning uninformed, to 5, meaning very well informed).</description>
