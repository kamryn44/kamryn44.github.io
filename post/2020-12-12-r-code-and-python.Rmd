# R code & Python

The *reticulation* package allows R code and Python to work together. 
```{r}
#reticulate::install_miniconda
#reticulate::py_install("pandas")

#install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```

This is an R code chunk.
```{r}
snowman <- "Frosty"
snowman
```

This is a Python code chunk. Python uses 'r.' to call an item defined by R code.
```{python}
print(r.snowman)
hohoho = "Santa"
print(r.snowman, hohoho)
```

This is an R code code chunk. R code uses 'py$' to call an item defined by Python.
```{r}
cat(c(snowman,py$hohoho))
```

**The following chunks use the *quakes* dataset to demonstrate a few uses of Python.**

Computing the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values for the variable "depth" in the quakes dataset.
```{python}
import pandas as pd

quakes=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/quakes.csv",index_col=0)

import numpy as np

np.min(quakes.depth)
np.max(quakes.depth) 
np.mean(quakes.depth)
np.median(quakes.depth)
```


Creating a new variable called depth_m that gives depth in meters rather than kilometers and adds it to the quakes dataset.
```{python}
quakes['depth_m']= np.multiply(quakes.depth, 1000)
quakes.head()
```


Gather, from Python, the median magnitude for quakes whose longitude is greater than 175.
```{python}
np.median(quakes[quakes.long>175].mag)
```


Creating a function that takes a string of nucleotides as input and returns a dictionary with all 3-mers present in that string, and the number of times that each 3-mer occurs. Then uses the function to find the 3-mers in the DNA sequence my_seq1 and my_seq2 given.
```{python}
import re
my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
my_seq2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"

def count_kmers(my_seq1):
    kmers=re.findall(r"[CTAG][CTAG][CTAG]", my_seq1)
    counts={}
    for c in kmers:
        if c in counts:
            counts[c]+=1
        else:
            counts[c]=1
            
    for c in counts:
        print(c,":", counts[c])
count_kmers(my_seq1)
count_kmers(my_seq2)
```

Happy holidays!
