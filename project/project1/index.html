<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
One of the two datasets is called <em>Political</em> (renamed to <em>college_voters</em>) and describes a dataset of the “Polical Behvaior of College Students”. After taking a simple random sample of 60 students at Grinnel College (United States) in 1992, two fellow college students were able to obtain 59 responses on nine variables through phone interviews. Of the nine variables, those that were used in this analysis included:“Year”- the class year of school the respondent was in; “Sex” - noted as a numeric observation, valuing male = 0 or female = 1; “Vote” - referencing the voting status of the respondent as they apply to the four options of 0 (not eligible to vote), 1 (elegible but not registered to vote), 2 (registered but did not vote), and 3 (voted); “Ethics” - a scale (1-5) of how the respondent believed politics should be ruled by (1 being on the side of <em>ethical considerations</em> and 5 on the side of <em>practical power</em>); and, lastly, “Inform” - another scale, this one representing how informed the respondent felt about politics (from 1, meaning uninformed, to 5, meaning very well informed).</p>
<p>The second dataset, called <em>Backpack</em>, was collected from a survey of students at California Polytechnic University in 2002, and describes the weights of college students’ backpacks (“BackpackWeight”) in comparison to each of those students’ body weight (“BodyWeight”), “Major”, year in school (“Year”), and number of credits being taken at the time of sampling (“Units”). These were each of the nine variables of 100 observations utilized in the analysis below in order to compare the possibility of them being correlated to the political actions of college students of the same age. A potential correlation lies between the variables regarding the heaviness of a student’s backpack, their major, how informed they feel about politics, and what year they are in school, along with how they participate in politics. I would assume that the heavier a student’s backpack is, and the longer they’ve been in school, the more likely they are to vote and feel informed about politics. Such a unique correlation, that I feel is a fair assumption to believe true, has not been proven. Therefore, I’ve gathered these two datasets eager to find out.</p>
<p><em>After working through this assignment for some time, it became clear that the two datasets were not a good fit for the required components. For the sake of submitting it on time, I proceeded anyway, applying my knowledge and understandings of the concepts as best I could with the data at hand.</em></p>

<p>###1.Tidying / 2.Joining / 3. Wrangling
The common ID variable between the two datasets I joined was “Year”, of which in both datasets was in reference to the year in college the respondent was in at the time of the survey. So, although the datasets were already tidy, there were multiple observations per category of year in both datasets, so quite a few summary statistics and adjustments had to first be applied to them separately in order to be able to join them on the same variable.
After renaming and recoding the confusing notation used throughout the datasets, I averaged over the numeric variables and gathered the counts of the categorical variables for those that had multiple observations per category of year (all of them). I was then able to join the two datasets (now <em>backpack4</em> and <em>Voters_join</em>) by left_join. In an effort to reduce the multiple observations per year of school (“Year”), I’d already formated each of the datasets so that they only included the necessary variables.Therefore, I performed a left_join in order to keep the columns of both datasets, while they joined on the variable “Year”, but I could have also performed a right_join or full_join, and gotten the same result. Prior to making any changes to the datasets, <em>college_voters</em> had 59 observations and <em>backpack</em> had 100, however, afterwards, I was left with a table with four rows and 17 columns, 16 of which were summarized statistics grouped on the variable Year (<em>Joined_labl</em>).</p>

<p>###3. Wrangling
Unsure of whether or not my joined table satisfied the requirement of the assignment to generate summary statistics with group_by (as to whether these needed to be performed after joining the data, rather than as a part of joining them), so I went ahead and performed such on the joined dataframe (<em>Joined_dat</em> - the joined dataframe without the summarized statistics labels in the columns in order to avoid confusion). However, this created summarized values of already summarized values, so it didn’t provide significant information (<em>Grouped_stats</em>). Anyhow, in the originally-joined dataframe (<em>Joined_labl</em>), I was able to see the results of applying the summarize function when grouping by Year. By using the mutate function to create a variable for the total number of voters represented in each category of year (“nTotal.Votes”), I was then able to calculate the proportion of each type of voting action that was taken for each category of year (“V0.Prop”, “V1.Prop”, etc.). Students in their fourth year of school evidently showed a much higher proportion of voting (V3.Prop) than those in their first year of school, which lined up with an increasing number of course hours (“Course.hrs”) being taken by the older age group as well.</p>
<p>The summarized statistics generated without grouping, and completely without the variable Year (because it’s a categorical variable), showed statistics for each type of variable for all four years (<em>Overall_stats</em>). The total number of the voting behaviors accounted for were thereby revealed to be 59 (the total number of obersvations in the original dataset <em>college_voters</em>), over half (68%) of which were accounted for by the number 3, meaning the student voted. Overall, the ungrouped summary statistics really only provided individual information for each of the variables, but was not very comparible for the use of assuming any correlations, especially without the category of Year.</p>

<p>###4. Visualizing</p>
<p>The heatmap of the numeric variables shows very sporatic correlations and no real trend (other than that between a variable and itself). The black represents a correlation, the white represents no correlation, and the red is the transitioning color between. There does appear to be a strong correlation between BackpackWeight and Year, as well as Course.hrs and the ratio between backpack weight and bodyweight. This heatmap is showing the correlation between averages and counts, so it’s formed from limited information. The sporatic correlations and lack thereof in this map is indicative of how uncorrelated the data is and/or unrepresentative of the true dataframe.</p>
<p>This was when I realized why I was struggling so much to understand the first portion of the project I’d created thus far. There were only four rows of observations for four years. Therefore any ggplot that used them had very, very minimal information (four points). To be able to create any graph that I could make observations from, I then decided to reorganize my dataframe to include more observations. For the first plot, I collapsed all of the voting proportions columns into one and their values into another. I then used this dataframe to map the different categories of proportions (“Type_prop”), the values of those proportions (“Proportion_vals”), and the year of school (“Year”). From the graph, it can be seen that none of the four age groups of students showed a consistent pattern of increasing/decreasing trend in the tendency of their behavior to move towards voting. It appears as though students tend to fall mostly into the categories of eligible/did not register and having voted. As would be assumed, the students who’ve been in college the longest, have the highest proportion of voters, while the students who’ve been in school for the least amount of time have voted the least. It’s interesting, however, to find that second-year college students tend to vote more than third-year. I would guess that this has to do with the excitement of their newfound eligibility.</p>
<p>In the second ggplot, I used the variables “Course.hrs”, “BackpackWeight”, and “Year”. Because the backpack was very similar between all variables, it can be assumed that the wide gaps of color are attributable to the summation effect on the course hours. The large amounts of blue on the right of the graph insinuate that third-year level students were taking courses that were worth more credit hours. The first-year students lied understandably to the left of the graph, being that classes tend to get harder/more intensive throughout college years following the first of a student’s. It cannot be concluded from this graph, however, that increased course hours is proportionate to increased backpack weight.</p>

###5. Dimensionality Reduction
After performing kmeans/PAM, there were a couple of interesting things found. The silhouette graph assured that 2 clusturs would be the best number of clusters to run by. On another note, it turns out that although BodyWeight isn’t a good variable to combine with Course.hrs in order to distinguish between the two clusters, BackpackWeight is very good at combining with Course.hrs to separate/distinguish the clusters from eachother. Also, the average PAM silhouette width for all four variables that were involved was 0.53788, which means that a reasonable structure has been found. The medoids, or the points most representative of their cluster for these variables in PAM, were 13 and 11 for BackpackWeight, 135 and 175 for Bodyweight, major codes: SOCS and CPE, and 16 for Course.hrs.</p>
